# Myopic

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/maumay/myopic.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/maumay/myopic)

Learning some Rust by porting my chess engine. Note that the unit tests are sprinkled amongst the source code (often residing in the same file which contains the code they are testing) and are removed by the compiler when it is time to build a release.

This is the final incarnation, I have learnt the value of choosing the right language for the job. Rust is perfect for a chess engine.
